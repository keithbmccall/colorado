# Colorado

## Colorado is an ios app for creative inspiration

###### Our mission is to assist in the creative design process by housing color and swatch references based on the world around us.

#### With Colorado Camera, a user can take a photograph and extract the prominent color values in the form of Swatches.

#### After which a user has the ability to save those swatches for future reference - called Palettes

#### Once Palettes are saved one can then access Colorado Vision and view that color through the viewport comparing it with the real life items in the room.
